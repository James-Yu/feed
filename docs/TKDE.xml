The existing methods treat it as a pathfinding problem on dynamic graphs, and extend A* algorithm with neuralized travel time estimators as cost functions. However, they fail to provide effective heuristic cost due to the neglect of its admissibility and the utilization of noise path information, resulting in sub...]]></summary>

In the nonnegative low rank matrix approximation method, the projection onto the manifold of fixed rank matrices can be expensive as the singular value decomposition is required.

Most of the existing graph convolutional networks share two big shortcomings. First, they are essentially low-pass filters, thus the potentially useful middle and high frequency band of graph signals are ignored. Second, the bandwidth of existing graph convolutional filters is fixed. Parameters of...]]></summary>

Existing algorithms on group anomalies mainly focus on homogeneous or bipartite networks, and thus are difficult to apply to heterogeneous networks directly. Moreover, these algorithms follow the non-overlapping hypothesis of groups implicitly, which is improper in many scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel algori...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive performance in a wide variety of areas, attracting considerable attention. The core step of GCNs is the information-passing framework that considers all information from neighbors to the central vertex to be equally important. Such equal importance, however, is inadequate for scale-free networks, where hub vertices propagate more dominan...]]></summary>
