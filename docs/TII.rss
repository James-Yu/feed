            <description><![CDATA[Real-time monitoring and control of breakthrough stage are essential issues in ultrafast laser drilling (ULD) process. This article proposed a novel intelligent methodology to address the decision bias problem in monitoring and control of breakthrough stage. Eight time-domain statistical features were extracted after analyzing the correlation between the optical emission signal and the drilling pr...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In most industrial applications, it is difficult to obtain complete demagnetization fault signals of all conditions with labels for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), and motors are not allowed to be disassembled, so non-contact diagnostic methods are essential. A non-contact fault diagnosis method using magnetic leakage signal based on wavelet scattering convolution network (WSCN) and sem...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Due to the limited presence of monitoring and measurement devices, timely identification of distribution grid topology has been challenging. Therefore, this article proposes a power grid topological generative adversarial network (Gridtopo-GAN) model to identify the distribution grid topology of either meshed or radial structure with limited measurements. By leveraging the topology preserved node ...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This article studies fully distributed data-driven problems for nonlinear discrete-time multiagent systems (MASs) with fixed and switching topologies preventing injection attacks. We first develop an enhanced compact form dynamic linearization model by applying the designed distributed bipartite combined measurement error function of the MASs. Then, a fully distributed event-triggered bipartite co...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Plant-wide optimization plays a vital role in improving the overall performance of large-scale industrial processes. Considering the modeling complexity and convergence difficulty of centralized plant-wide optimization, in this article, we propose a distributed framework by decomposing the global optimization problem into a set of subproblems, where multiple local units interact with each other be...]]></description>
