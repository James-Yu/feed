            <description><![CDATA[Recently, with the superior capacity for analyzing the multiplex graph data, self-supervised multiplex graph representation learning (SMGRL) has received much interest. However, existing SMGRL methods are still limited by the following issues: (i) they generally ignore the noisy information within each graph and the common information among different graphs, thus weakening the effectiveness of SMG...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This paper deals with imbalanced time series classification problems. In particular, we propose to learn time series classifiers that maximize the minimum recall of the classes rather than the accuracy. Consequently, we manage to obtain classifiers which tend to give the same importance to all the classes. Unfortunately, for most of the traditional classifiers, learning to maximize the minimum rec...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Scholar clustering has garnered increasing attention due to the explosive growth of scholar data. Although researchers have proposed many algorithms to cluster scholars, they typically focus on clustering scholars from the intrinsic view (scholars&#39; contents). These algorithms may lead to inaccurate and biased clustering results because they ignore the extrinsic view (scholar&#39;s specialty) and the c...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[One key property in recommender systems is the long-tail distribution in user-item interactions where most items only have few user feedback. Improving the recommendation of tail items can promote novelty and bring positive effects to both users and providers, and thus is a desirable property of recommender systems. Current novel recommendation methods over-emphasize the importance of tail items w...]]></description>

To further improve the efficiency, we propose a novel index structure called BCCIndex, based on an idea of ...]]></description>

Their exponential network effects depend on the fact that each user can share her daily digital footprints with different communities, in different places, and at different times (for example in the form of check-in activities). Unlike other types of social networks, activities in an LBSN can potentially be performed by s...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Most recommendation systems focus on predicting rating or finding aspect information in reviews to understand user preferences and item properties. However, these methods ignore the effectiveness and persuasiveness of recommendation results. Consequently, explainable recommendation, namely providing recommendation results with recommendation reasons at the same time, has attracted increasing atten...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Measuring similarity between two objects is the core operation in existing clustering algorithms in grouping similar objects into clusters. This paper introduces a new similarity measure called point-set kernel which computes the similarity between an object and a set of objects. The proposed clustering procedure utilizes this new measure to characterize every cluster grown from a seed object. We ...]]></description>

An effective job description will help employers to identify the right talents for the job, and give a clear understanding to candidates of what their duties and qualifications for a particular position would be. However, due to the variation in experiences, it is always a challenge for both hi...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Semi-supervised clustering (SSC) aims to improve clustering performance with the support of prior knowledge (i.e., side information). Compared with pairwise constraints, the partial labeling information is more natural to characterize the data distribution in a high level. However, the natural gap between the class information and the clustering is not adequately taken into account in exiting SSC ...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Deep clustering usually treats the clustering assignments as supervisory signals to learn a more compact representation with deep neural networks, under the guidance of clustering-oriented losses. Nevertheless, we observe that, without reliable supervision, such losses for global clustering would destroy the locally geometric structure underlying data. In this paper, we propose a local-to-global d...]]></description>

Sparse coefficients and a space projection matrix can be simultaneously learned. The global structures and local neighborhood properties are ...]]></description>

With the increasing size of data graphs, an entity is often associated with too many property values to be entirely shown to the user, thereby requiring a compact but characteristic summary to present its most distinguishing features. This paper aims to automatically generate such characterist...]]></description>

If we regard the users participating in the rumor as image pixels, similar to social networks, the recovery of pixel data is affected by the pixels themselves and neighbor pixels, then the prediction of user behavior in the rumor diffusion can be regarded as the process of image restoration for pixel-blurred user behavior images. ...]]></description>
