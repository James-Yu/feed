        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for developing more intelligent autonomous vehicles (AVs). A typical DRL application on AVs is to train a neural network-based driving policy. However, the black-box nature of neural networks can result in unpredictable decision failures, making such AVs unreliable. To this end, this work proposes a method to identify and protec...]]></summary>

Despite the wide usage of the GNSS in populated urban areas, it is difficult to suggest a generalized method because multipath errors are user-specific and cannot be eliminated by the differential GNSS (DGNSS) or a real-time kinematic technique (RTK). ...]]></summary>
