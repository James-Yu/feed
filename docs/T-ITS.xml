In this paper, an A2G channel model with UAV three-dimensional (3D) wobbles (pitch, roll, and yaw) based on the geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) is proposed. On this basis, the UAV’s internal vibration is modeled as a sinusoidal random process, and the UAV wobble ...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent works on 3D single object tracking treat the task as a target-specific 3D detection task, where an off-the-shelf 3D detector is commonly employed for the tracking. However, it is non-trivial to perform accurate target-specific detection since the point cloud of objects in raw LiDAR scans is usually sparse and incomplete. In this paper, we address this issue by explicitly leveraging temporal...]]></summary>
