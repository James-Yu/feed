        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electric vehicles (EVs) are believed to be effective in reducing the use of fossil fuels. However, the increasing penetration of EVs can lead to challenges in managing EV charging/refueling. Typically, when EVs simultaneously gather at the stations, long queueing lengths and waiting times might occur, which might result in EV disutility. Thus, in this paper, novel decision-making strategies consid...]]></summary>
